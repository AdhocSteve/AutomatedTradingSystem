# AutomatedTradingSystem

The purpose of this repository is to journal 
 my own algorithmic trading journey and 
help fill some knowledge gaps for those 
starting their own journey as well. 

Some may relate to the struggle of 
finding what seems to be a promising
tutorial filled with script that 
cannot be executed and debugging is still
a foreign concept. Or perhaps you are 
a saavy programmer but developing
an investing strategy is not
yet your forte. 

By no means am I an expert on either subject, having 
have found myself in both the situations described above
sometime ago. Again my aim here is primarily to document my own 
algorithmic journey but perhaps someone else can benefit from my memoir 
on the subject. 

By benefit I mean establish enough of a foundat
foundation both in the investing and programming sense 
to aid in the developement of your own stratgies then
eventually implement them with some confidence out in the
real world. 


which is why this journal 
The outline for this will be something like
- setting up your development environment
- the Robinhood API
- cleaning up data
- fundamental
