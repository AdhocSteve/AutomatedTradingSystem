# AutomatedTradingSystem

The purpose of this repository is to journal 
 my own algorithmic trading journey and 
help fill some knowledge gaps for those 
starting their own journey as well. 

Some may relate to the struggle of 
finding what seems to be a promising
tutorial filled with script that 
cannot be executed and debugging is still
a foreign concept. Or perhaps you are 
a saavy programmer already but developing
an investing strategy is not
yet your forte. 

By no means am I an expert on either subject, having 
have found myself in both the situations described above
sometime ago. Again my aim here is primarily to document my own 
algorithmic journey but perhaps someone else can benefit from my memoir 
surrounding the subject. Of course I welcome any feedback and questions. 

By benefit I mean establish enough of a 
foundation both in the investing and programming sense 
to aid in the developement of ones own trading stratgies that will 
eventually be implemented with some confidence out in the
real world. 

So without further ado lets begin.
The outline for this repo will be something like this: 
- setting up your development environment (handled further down in this README)
- the Robinhood API and processing data
- building a portfolio via fundamental analysis
- Entry and Exit points via Technical Analysis
- Building a Trading Agent
- Backtesting
  
Supplemented with excerpts mostly from the Intelligent Investor, a book worth anyones time reading,, as well as other useful material from 
Investopeida, Medium, Youtube and other great sources that I will be sure to cite. 

# Setting Up Your Development Environment
Alright I'll assume that if you're browsing Git then you are already familiar with either Ubuntu, WSL2, Docker or Anaconda.
