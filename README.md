# AutomatedTradingSystem

The purpose of this repository is to journal 
 my own algorithmic trading journey and 
help fill some knowledge gaps for those 
starting their own journey as well. 

Some may relate to the struggle of 
finding what seems to be a promising
tutorial filled with script that 
cannot be executed and debugging is still
a foreign concept. Or perhaps you are 
a saavy programmer but developing
an investing strategy is not
yet your forte. 

I have found myself on both 
of these situations hence this journal. 


which is why this journal 
The outline for this will be something like
- setting up your development environment
- the Robinhood API
- cleaning up data
- fundamental
